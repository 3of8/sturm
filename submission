Title: Sturm's Theorem

Entry name: Sturm_Sequences

Abstract:

Sturm sequences are a method of efficiently computing the number of real
roots of a real polynomial inside a given interval. This work contains 
a proof of Sturm's Theorem, which states that Sturm sequences count 
polynomials, and code for constructing Sturm chains efficiently. It also 
provides the “sturm” proof method, which can decide certain statements about 
the roots of real polynomials, such as “the polynomial P has exactly n roots 
in the interval I” or “P(x) > Q(x) for all x ∈ ℝ”.
